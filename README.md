# homeassistant-hovalconnect2mqtt

This integration tries to scrape various information from connect.hoval.com.

Curently this is a read-only integration. So it is not possible to change anything in hovalconnect.

Hoval uses the SAP cloud. During the login process the webscraper gets redirected to four different websites which seems to be quite unstable for now.
